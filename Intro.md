Projects I've done as undergraduate student at Oregon Statue University

**Fantasy Combat Game**
*Utilized C++ language to create multiple character objects with unique performance modifiers, placed into team queues to fight, accumulating and displaying team points and announce winning team.

**Space Exploration Game**
*Built game in C++ using doubly linked list ADT to connect space objects and assign hint objects in each room for player to explore, with random events that impact player timing and ability; created additional bag ADT to store collected items used to unlock puzzle within given time frame/number of steps. 

**Personal Web Page**
*Built personal web page using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, with AJAX request integration for visitor counter and contact form.
